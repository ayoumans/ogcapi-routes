== Conformance

This Standard defines the following requirements and conformance classes:

* Minimal routing capability:
** **Core**: Routing based on start/end point
* Additional API capabilities:
** **Asynchronous execution**: Return the route in the response to the routing request
** **Callback**: Support for call to a webhook after the route is computed
** **Delete route**: Cancel/delete routes
** **Result set**: Request parts of the Route Exchange Model, e.g., in DDIL situations
* Additional routing parameters:
** **Intermediate waypoints**: Pass through additional points along the route
** **Height restrictions**: Consider a specified vehicle height in meters against known height restrictions when computing the route
** **Load restrictions**: Consider a specified vehicle weight in tons against known weight restrictions when computing the route
** **Obstacles**: Avoid obstacles
** **Temporal constraints**: Specify departure/arrival time

Requirements for a single standardization target types are considered: Web API.
