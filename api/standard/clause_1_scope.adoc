== Scope

This document specifies the behavior of a Web API that allows applications to request routes in a manner independent of the underlying data store, routing engine or algorithm. This standard defines discovery and query operations.

Discovery operations enable clients to interrogate the API and retrieve the API definition, metadata about the API and a list of conformance classes supported by the API.

Query operations enable, at a minimum, clients to send a request consisting of two waypoints, the start and end point of the route, to the API and to retrieve from the API a route represented as a GeoJSON feature collection.
