== Scope

This document specifies the behavior of a Web API that allows applications to request routes in a manner independent of the underlying routing data set, routing engine or algorithm. 

This standard defines modular API building blocks to 

* compute new routes,
* specify additional, commonly used routing parameters in addition to the start and end point of the route,
* manage routes on the server.

Routes are represented as a GeoJSON feature collection according to the OGC Route Exchange Model.

In addition, the API supports building blocks that enable clients to interrogate the API and retrieve the API definition, and a list of conformance classes supported by the API.
