[big]*i.     Abstract*

The Route Exchange Model represents a route as a JSON document in a standardized way that is independent of the underlying data, routing engine software, and algorithms that are used to compute the route.

For example, the complementary standard OGC API - Routes - Part 1: Core uses the Route Exchange Model to represent and share routes with users on the web.

For providers of routes, the API building blocks and the Route Exchange Model provide a simple model to publish and offer those routes as resources for use by other systems.
 
For users, applications, and enterprises, the capability to get routes in a common format, regardless of the underlying routing data, engines, or algorithms, represents a significant step forward in geospatial interoperability.
