[[RouteExchangeModel]]
== Route Exchange Model

=== Overview

This document specifies a single encoding of the Route model described in the previous clause for the creation and transfer of route information between a variety of routing components ("Route Exchange Model"). The encoding uses https://geojson.org/[GeoJSON] to represent routes according to the model described above and is defined in the next clause. 

A GeoJSON feature collection is used to represent the Route. Each RouteComponent is represented by a GeoJSON feature in the feature collection of the route. 

GeoJSON is used for the following reasons:

* lightweight
* extensible
* widely supported in libraries and tools
* consistent with the emerging https://www.ogcapi.ogc.org/[OGC API standards]
* an https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946[open standard]

=== Requirements class "Route Exchange Model"

This requirement class states requirements that apply to all representations of a route.

See <<rem-example>> for an example of a route.

The normative statements use JSON Schema to specify schema components.
